It’s fair to say that React 16.8 and the introduction of
https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html[hooks] has really changed how
we write React. Hooks are one of those APIs that make you realise the
flaws of the previous approach _after_ you stop using it. I remember
being very skeptical of hooks when they were first released, not
thinking that the previous class based design had many flaws, but I’ve
since come to realise I was very wrong, and hooks are a vast improvement
on how we build React components. If you’re interested in comparing the
old vs the new, I wrote a link:/refactoring-to-react-hooks/[blog post
refactoring a component to use hooks] that offers a nice comparison.
